# 🌍 Environmental Twin — Weather-Aware Bullet Simulation

> ⚡ Bringing physics and weather together in one interactive 3D simulation  

![Demo Screenshot](docs/demo.png)

---

## ✨ Overview
**Environmental Twin** is a unique project that combines **real-time weather forecasts** with **ballistics physics** to create an **interactive digital twin** of the environment.  

Using **Babylon.js** for 3D rendering and **Streamlit + Python** for data processing, the app visualizes how **wind, humidity, and air pressure** affect a bullet’s trajectory — in **slow motion**.  

This is not just about bullets — it’s a fun and educational way to **see physics in action**.

---

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ **Weather-aware simulation** — wind, humidity, and pressure influence the bullet path  
- ✅ **Slow-motion visualization** — watch the bullet drift and curve in 3D space  
- ✅ **Digital Twin concept** — creates a live “environmental twin” of your data  
- ✅ **Fallback to synthetic data** when no real dataset or models are available  
- ✅ **Interactive 3D controls** — rotate, zoom, and fire bullets in the scene

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) (3D graphics engine)  
- **Backend**: Python + [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (interactive UI)  
- **Data/ML**: Joblib models + Pandas + Numpy  
- **Simulation**: Custom physics powered by weather data

📊 Example Weather Inputs

🌬 Wind speed: 8 km/h

🧭 Wind direction: 45°

💧 Humidity: 55%

⏱ Pressure: 1015 hPa

These parameters affect how the bullet drifts off its target in real time.
